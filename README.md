12/12 | Saturday building the basic structure
16.36 | Created initial html and style files
16.45 | Don't forget to use "margin 0 auto" to center elements in a div
16.50 | Use 940 width for containers inside divs
16.58 | I would name the container "hero__container" and put the text inside "Hero Container"
18.42 | Had to change the header container height to 64 to make the button fit
20.01 | Commit updated hero section
20.42 | Changed the sizes to more modern look for the features aside section.
21.36 | Had to darken the get section, finished up to footer section Git commit
21.45 | In this section we start doing placeholder images, he recommends placehold.it but there is also a vscode addin you can use called [Placeholder Images](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JakeWilson.vscode-placeholder-images) by Jake Wilson.
22.24 | Adding some placeholder images in the background and some interactivity to buttons
23.08 | Added button roll-over effect with linear-gradient color changes.
23.30 | Finished by chaning the size of each section to full view hight. In the future I should be able to use this as a template for a wireframe and just change the components and dimensions.
